/*
 * Decompress the String
 * 
 * Description

Given a string of lowercase characters and integers, decompress the string under the following rules:

- If an integer is encountered, the character just before it gets added to a final string as many times as the number

For instance, if the string is "a3b2" => the output should be "aaabb" because *a* is followed by 3, and *b* is followed by 2

Write a program that decompresses the string based on rules above
