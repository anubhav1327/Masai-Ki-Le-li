Givenn, return the value of Tn mod 10^9+7.


Input
Input Format

The first line contains the number of testcase T

Then T lines follow, each containing an integer N

Constraints

1<=T<=10^5

1<=N<=50


Output
For each test case print the value of Tn in a new line


Sample Input 1 

1
4
Sample Output 1

4
Hint

T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
